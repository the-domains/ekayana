the subtle connection between mind, body and movement in the tranquil and sublime setting of pristine nature.</p><p>Having climbed for many years John began a more formal meditation practice through the tradition of Rinzai Zen, working with a Rinzai Zen Master by the name of Dae Gak at a small Korean temple in Eastern Kentucky.</p><p>Introduced to the practice of meditation and self-enquiry would begin a lifelong journey of discovering his true-nature through the traditional practices and wisdom of the East.</p><p>Shortly after, in 2002, Ashtanga Yoga provided a perfect fusion of tangible and intense body movement, combined with the subtlety of breath work and mental concentration that somehow embodied both the essence of rock-climbing and zen meditation.</p><p>John continued a largely self-directed practice, fusing his climbing born bodily intuition and zen training to inform his asana practice.</p><p>Though climbing took him to various locations around the country, and even as far as Canada and Mexico, there was still a deeper pull to explore more exotic and foreign lands.</p><p>His first trip abroad was to Japan in 2007 and was then that he began practicing the mysore style of ashtanga with certified teacher Basia Lipska.</p><p>A deep love for the self-directed style of the mysore method further motivated him to take responsibility and deepen his own self-practice. </p><p>After Japan opened up his horizons to the wisdom and allure of the east, mystical India pulled at the strings of his heart and it was in December of 2007, after graduating college, that he found himself on a one-way ticket to India.</p><p>The open-ended pilgrimage to India lasted over a year and carried him through the enchanted land and transformed his sense of being, his understanding of the world and solidified his love and relationship to the path of Yoga and Meditation. </p><p>Encountering mystics and teachers around the country from a variety of traditions his bandwidth of understanding and encounters with different styles and dimensions of yoga opened his vista to the vastness and profound yet simple teachings of this ancient path. </p><p>John furthered his studies of Yoga in Thailand at the Agama Yoga school under the direction of Swami Vivekenanda-Saraswati in the winter and spring of 2009, completing his first 500-hour TTC.</p><p>Shortly after, he made his way back to Japan where he began teaching for the next 5 years. </p><p>While Johnâ€™s primary sadhana is the Ashtanga Vinyasa method in the tradition of Sri K Pattabhi Jois, his practice is supplemented by traditional and esoteric hatha yoga methods from the Agama and Hridaya schools.</p><p>The center of his spiritual quest remains rooted in self-enquiry and a direct perception of the underlying essence, or sub-stratum, of our formless being.</p><p>Though incorporating the simplicity of Zen, the method of enquiry, or atma-vichara, as proposed by the Advaita Vedanta master Ramana Maharisi, is the central thread that runs though is entire life, uniting the dynamic practice of Ashtanga with the stillness and serenity of earnest inquiry into our deeper nature. </p><p>In total, John has completed three 500-hour TTC programs, with Agama Yoga in 2009, Tattva Yoga Shala in 2012, and most recently, a meditation based TTC with Hridaya Yoga in 2014.</p><p>He his a Yoga Alliance certified E-RYT 500 yoga instructor and holds intensives, workshops and teacher trainings around the world.</p><p>He has taught around the world, but most notably in Japan and Mexico.</p><p>Future plans include moving to India to continue to life, practice and teach. </p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw
